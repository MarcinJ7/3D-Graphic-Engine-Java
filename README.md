Description
=============

3D Graphic Engine was implemented in Java. There are a lot of options such as zoom, rotation or moving. A programmer can add an objects (in my code there are a cubes), and after run a program - user can use keyboard keys to make a zoom, rotate or move a camera. Project is based mainly on trygonometric transformations.You can find a screenshots of every operation below.

Elimination of hidden elements algorithm
=================

There was implemented an elimination of hidden elements algorithm. I use a Painter's algorithm. You can see an effect of it on pictures below.

Summary
=====

Project was implemented without any specialistic libraries. There are a lot of mathematical calculations implemented, but it works quite smooth. An Painter algorithm was a great choice for this project - it is not very hard to implement, but it can give good results.
